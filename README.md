#### JPA Specification logic to build multiple AND conditions dynamically based on the input given:

```
    public static Specification<Employee> findByDepartmentNameAndSalaryRange(String departmentName, BigDecimal minSalary, BigDecimal maxSalary) {
        return new Specification<Employee>() {
            @Override
            public Predicate toPredicate(Root<Employee> root, CriteriaQuery<?> query, CriteriaBuilder builder) {
            Join<Employee, Department> departmentJoin = root.join(Employee_.department);

                List<Predicate> predicates = new ArrayList<>();
                if (nonNull(departmentName)) {
                    predicates.add(builder.and(builder.equal(departmentJoin
                            .get(Department_.DEPARTMENT_NAME), departmentName)));
                }
                if (nonNull(minSalary) & nonNull(maxSalary)) {
                    predicates.add(builder.and(builder.between(root.get(Employee_.salary), minSalary, maxSalary)));
                }
                return builder.and(predicates.toArray(new Predicate[0]));
            }
        };
    }
```

#### Above code is JPA Specification logic builds dynamic query that satisfied all the below requirements:

1. Search all the employees from departmentName = IT
    > GET http://localhost:8080/employees?departmentName=IT
2. Search all the employees whose salary range between '4800' and '6000' regardless of all the departments
   > GET http://localhost:8080/employees?minSalary=4800&maxSalary=6000
3. Search all the employees whose salary range between '4800' and '6000' in 'IT' department
   > GET http://localhost:8080/employees?departmentName=IT&minSalary=4800&maxSalary=6000

## Performance and Best Practices of Fetch Types

#### Table scan without: FetchType.LAZY

**Note:** Here without `FetchType.LAZY` unnecessary joins all the tables, and does all columns scan in the SELECT

		select
			e1_0.employee_id,
			e1_0.commission_pct,
			d1_0.department_id,
			d1_0.department_name,
			d1_0.location_id,
			d1_0.manager_id,
			e1_0.email,
			e1_0.first_name,
			e1_0.hire_date,
			j1_0.job_id,
			j1_0.max_salary,
			j1_0.min_salary,
			j1_0.job_title,
			e1_0.last_name,
			m1_0.employee_id,
			m1_0.commission_pct,
			d2_0.department_id,
			d2_0.department_name,
			d2_0.location_id,
			d2_0.manager_id,
			m1_0.email,
			m1_0.first_name,
			m1_0.hire_date,
			j2_0.job_id,
			j2_0.max_salary,
			j2_0.min_salary,
			j2_0.job_title,
			m1_0.last_name,
			m1_0.manager_id,
			m1_0.phone_number,
			m1_0.salary,
			e1_0.phone_number,
			e1_0.salary 
		from
			employees e1_0 
		left join
			departments d1_0 
				on d1_0.department_id=e1_0.department_id 
		left join
			jobs j1_0 
				on j1_0.job_id=e1_0.job_id 
		left join
			employees m1_0 
				on m1_0.employee_id=e1_0.manager_id 
		left join
			departments d2_0 
				on d2_0.department_id=m1_0.department_id 
		left join
			jobs j2_0 
				on j2_0.job_id=m1_0.job_id 
		where
			e1_0.employee_id=?

#### Table scan with: FetchType.LAZY

**Note:** Here with `FetchType.LAZY` only necessary joins tables will happen, and select the columns whichever are required in the SELECT

    select
        e1_0.employee_id,
        e1_0.commission_pct,
        e1_0.department_id,
        e1_0.email,
        e1_0.first_name,
        e1_0.hire_date,
        e1_0.job_id,
        e1_0.last_name,
        e1_0.manager_id,
        e1_0.phone_number,
        e1_0.salary 
    from
        employees e1_0 
    join
        departments d1_0 
            on d1_0.department_id=e1_0.department_id 
    where
        d1_0.department_name=? 
        and e1_0.salary between ? and ?
